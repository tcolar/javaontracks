    This contains a webapp server impl. (not full-stack J2EE at this time)
    This is the bare minimum to support JOT webapps.
    It's really easy to use/setup (no XML)
    It DOES provide standard HttpServletRequest and HttpResponse objects, but does not support the full J2EE stack, such as:
    ServletContext, Filters etc...
